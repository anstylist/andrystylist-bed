# Backend Landing page Andrystylist

This is a page designed so you can register, log in, retrieve your password by sending an email, and you can also see the services that Andrystylist offers. It is built with an open source headless CMS (Content Management System) based on Node.js.

**Technologies Used**
**Node.js:** Node.js is a runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript on the server-side. It's the foundation of our backend.

**Strapi:** Strapi is an open source headless CMS (Content Management System) based on Node.js. A headless CMS is a CMS that separates the backend from the frontend.

**JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** JWTs are used for user authentication. When a user logs in, a JWT is generated and sent to the client, which is then included in subsequent requests to authenticate the user.

**Cloudinary:** Cloudinary is a cloud-based image and video management platform that allows developers to optimize, deliver and transform images and videos quickly and easily.

**Api Documentation swagger**
Swagger is a set of open source tools for designing, building, documenting and using RESTful web services.

## Database
El backend utiliza PostgreSQL como base de datos para almacenar informaci√≥n del usuario, datos de servicios y productos.
